# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

Overview: The purpose of the Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis is to use our knowledge of machine learning and the neural network to create a binary classifier that can predict whether an applicant will be successful if founded by Alphabet Soup. We were provided with 34.000 data of the organization that has received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
Results: The variables below are considered as the targets or features for the model
•	APPLICATION_TYPE
•	AFFILIATION
•	CLASSIFICATION
•	USE_CASE
•	ORGANIZATION
•	STATUS
•	INCOME_AMT
•	SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS
•	ASK_AMT
The variables below are not considered as the targets or features for the model
•	EIN
•	NAME
I used 1 input features and 2 hidden layers
•	number_input_features = 43
•	hidden_nodes_layer1 = 80
•	hidden_nodes_layer2 = 30
•	Increasing the number of hidden layers to include a 3rd
•	Changing the activation functions: tried linear, tanh, sigmoid for a combination of hidden layers and output layer
Summary: I was unable to achieve the target model performances. I am able to reach 66.7% accuracy. The target accuracy was not achieved despite trying other methods to improve the performance. Perhaps having more datasets and features will help
